    Options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -t, --test            Run doctests
     -d DB, --db=DB        Path to game history database
     -w WIDTH, --width=WIDTH
                           Card width
     -o OFFSET, --offset=OFFSET
                           If the 10s make the cards different widths then try
                           some different numbers here


In iTerm I run it like `./freecell.py -w 8 -o 2`

This is just an experiment. My intention is to refactor and create a new
project for more card games.
