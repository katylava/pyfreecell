-- a better way to do a REPL, including custom completion

when replaying a completed game, save as new game -- maybe create
option to play with same deck as another game

sometimes empty columns get the wrong letter, then you
also can't move to them

move gameplay procedural stuff to a seperate file from the class
declarations

create GamePlay class instead of all that procedural code
change history.get() so it returns tuple inside of list instead of whole list of results... as it should always only return one result anyway

add plain 'restart' move for use during gameplay to
restart the current game

don't quit after save, or make save take options like
'save and quit', 'save and new', 'save and restart'

instead of using ---- for blanks in board, use colorize
with var=underline and set a different bg for blanks. also color
hints and draw border around board

invalid card move errors are hidden by screen clear
